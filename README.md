# MC3
Monte Carlo simulation code for molecular crystals

The code enables MC simulations of molecular crystals in the NPT and NVT ensembles. The former is useful for computing lattice parameters and elastic constants. The molecules are treated as rigid bodies. Intermolecular bonding is described by a set of atom-centered point charges and generic Buckingham potentials from DE Williams.
